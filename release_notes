Jaakon Git v1.0.3.0

New Features

1. New Powerful Search
  - Click on the magnifier icon in the top-right corner or hit Ctrl+, and start typing
  - Search for commits, branches, files and authors
  - Results are suggested as you type
  - Hold Ctrl for alternative commands. For example, open any file in a repository by typing its name and hitting Ctrl+Enter once it is suggested.

2. Git Blame
  - To annotate a file with commits that introduced any change,
    1. Make the file visible in the diff area e.g. by searching for it,
    2. Right-click in the diff area and select "Blame (annotate)".
  - Navigate to the commit that modified a line by clicking on the annotation column on that line
  - Even deleted lines are annotated, making it effortless to find the actual commit that intoduced the change, past any formatting changes.

3. Custom text & rebase todo editors
  - New simple and user-friendly tools to edit commit messages and rebase todo sequences e.g. while rebasing
  - Can be disabled in the Settings in the unlikely event that you have better editors set in git config

4. Navigation
  - Navigate between previous views with Alt+Left/Right or the mouse thumb buttons
  - Might have some limitations, still evaluating if this is a useful feature
